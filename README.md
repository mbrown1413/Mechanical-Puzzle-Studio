# Riddlewood Studio

Mechanical puzzle design software.

The focus is on put-together / take-apart / interlocking puzzles. Riddlewood Studio is very extensible; with some programming knowledge, you can create new grid types, arbitrary constraints for when a puzzle is considered solved, and more.

**Note: This software is in pre-alpa development.** To track progress, see the [MVP Planning](https://github.com/mbrown1413/Riddlewood-Studio/issues/1) issue.
